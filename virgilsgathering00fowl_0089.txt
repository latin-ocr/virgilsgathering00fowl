Virgil's “Gathering of the Clans²⁷

engraved on it, seems tame after the Chimaera, and
I almost wish it had been struck out of the picture.
The background of this picture is filled with the
innumerable hosts that followed Turnus out of all
the coast towns from the Tiber to the Pomptino
marshes among which the Ufens river “ searched for
a way ''; and again to the promontory of Circe and
the city of Anxur, home of a youthful Jupiter and
‘of a famous numen of Latium, Feronia.

Virgil had already been close upon this region in
describing the followers of Halaesus (723 ff), and
returns to it with obvious pleasure:

“ (Qui) . . . Rutulosque exercent vomere colles
Circaeumque iugum, quis Iuppiter Anxurus arvis
praesidet, et viridi gaudens Feronia luco.'’

Few of us have been travellers on this bit of coast;
but those who chance to have read a delightful ac-
count of it by Dr. James Sully, in the Quarterly
Review for 1911, 377 ff„ will understand how much
is compressed into these few words, and perhaps how
willingly the poet would have lingered here if his
theme had allowed it. The title of the article is
“ Terracina‚'' which was the later Roman name for the
settlement over which Iuppiter Anxur poesided, and

 

fighting Turnus does not wear this marvellous helmet:
ix. 50, “ crista tegit galea aurea rubra⁷'; xii. 89, “rubrae
cornua cristae.” Nothing can better show the idealising in
this passage. The wild picture of Turnus presented in the
pageant by means of this helmet is in contrast with the
princely guise and demeanour of Aeneas in the fighting to
come; but the weak point in his character, the fact that he
fights for his own interest only, is not alluded to here.
