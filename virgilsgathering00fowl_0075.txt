Romans (among whom we may reckon Virgil for
literary purposes) did not take an interest in the

Sabine deity Vacuna is not mentioned either by
Virgil or Servius, though the poet was close upon
her at Reate and the lacus Velinus; 1 Rome had no

translating “ Their shields resound with the striking
of the spears, and the earth with the tramp of their
feet.” The line would exactly suit the action of the
Salii, who were almost certainly a priestly survival of
the old Italian warrior. These struck their ancilia
