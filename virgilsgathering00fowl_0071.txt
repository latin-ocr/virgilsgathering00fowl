Virgil's “Gathering of the Clans''

nor any fortified place that we know of. But Con-
ington sends us to Georg. ii. 535 for an example of
the use of arces “ of mountain heights‚'' to which when
we turn, we find that the mountain heights are those
of the several hills of Rome! There is no parallel
between these and Soracte: and I do not remember
any passage in which our poet uses arx of any place
but a hill within a city, for which, in fact, it was
reserved in a special sense. “Arx ab arcendo,'’ says
Varro, “ quod is locus munitissimus urbis, a quo
facillime possit hostis prohiberi.”1 Is it possible that
arces and acies got into wrong lines through a “slip
of the pen '’ (or of the eye), either of the poet himself
or an early copyist, and that we should read “ Fescen-
ninas arces ’' and “Soractis acies”? If so, Ι should
understand “ acies ’' as meaning “sharp edges''—
arentes, as they are called in the Alps. “ Acies ’' is not
a technical word like “ arx,'' and might be used in many
different ways Soracte is about 2,42O feet high, and
its outline is a striking one, as all know who have
ever been at Rome. But for “ acies '’ in this sense Ι can
find no parallel in the “ Thesaurus Latinitatis.”

The description of Messapus and his men should
end, I feel sure, with the imperfect line pulsa palus.
Here there is a pause, as in ii. 767, iii. 218, and
other incomplete lines,2 and to take up the same sub-
ject again with another simile of the same kind, is
quite unlike Virgil. The first one is Homeric and
