Virgil's “ Gathering of the Clans'’

Then, gliding from on high, the queen of heaven
With her own hand the lingering portals pushed,
And Saturn's daughter upon back-swung hinge
Asunder burst the iton-bound gates of war.
Ausonia, erst supine, immovabk,
Anon takes fire. Some gird them o'er the plain
To march afoot; some, mounted on tall steeds,
Storm through a cloud of dust; all shout for arms.
Some furbish with rich lard the buckler smooth,
The javelin bright‚ or on the whetstone wear
Their axes to an edge: with joy they thrill
To advance the standard, hear the trumpet bray.
Five mighty cities set their anvils up
To fashion arms anew—Atina strong,
Proud Tibur, Ardea, and Crustumeri,
And turret-crowned Antemnae. For head-gear
Helmets they hollow, and for the boss of shields
Bend wicker—plait; some corslets beat from brass,
Smooth greaves from pliant silver. E'en to this
The pride of share ancl hook, to this hath fall’n
All passion for the plough: their father's swords
I’ the furnace they re-temper. And now sounds
The clarion, speeds the watchword for the war.
One in hot haste plucks helm from house-wall ; one
Couples his snorting coursers to the yoke,
In shield and hauberk triple-twilled with gold
Arrays him, and girds trusty sword on thigh.
Now, Muses, ope the gates of Helicon
And wake the song—what kings were roused to war,
What hosts behind them following filled the plain;
Bloomed with what heroes, with what armour burncd,
