Virgil's “ Gathering of the Clans

To highth of noblest temper heroes old

Arming to battle, and instead of fage

Deliberate valour breathed, firm and unmoved
With dread of death to ssight or foul retreat;

Nor wanting power to mitigate and 'swage

With solemn touches troubled thoughts, and chase
Anguish and doubt and fear and sorrow and pain
From mortal and immortal minds.'‘

And from this point, on to the end of the book,
nearly two hundred and fifty lines, the great
diapason never once ceases to resound.
