Virgil’s “ Gathering of the Clans”

fully argued out, to the length of several pageS, in
Henry’s commentary on vi. 620 :

“ Discite iustitiam moniti et non temnere divos,'’

and each of these pages is worth attentive study. I
find the argument, with its abundant illustration
from Greek and Latin literature, quite conclusive:
iustitia is conceived as obedience to the law of
heaven : morality is under the protection of the gods.

Now this was certainly a Greek rather than a
Roman or Italian idea:1 and it has often been
asserted that the Roman deities and their cult had
nothing to do with morality. But this, as I have
observed elsewhere,² is going altogether too far; we
have only to think of the religious sanction of the
oath, and of the religious penalties attached to cer-
tain crimes, ag„ parricidium or arson, where the
criminal was made over, cursed and consecrated, to
the deity most immediately concerned, to satisfy our-
selves that the connection between morality and reli-
gion was in reality very close—so close that they may
well have originated in the same layer of human ex-
perience.³ “Discite iustitiam moniti et non temnere
divos '’—“ set not at naught the divine commandment
to be just or righteous.” It is satisfactory to find
