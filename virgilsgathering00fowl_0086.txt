Virgil‘s “Gathering of the Clans”

Aricia, in the woods by the lake (of Nemi), much used
and full of grace. (2) There was a taboo here on
horses, which forbade them to enter the precincts of
the altar; which reminds us that the most ancient
priest of Latium, the Flamen Dialis, was forbidden to

ride on a horse, and may help to assure us of the
primitive character of this cult of Diana. Such
taboos would arise when the use of the horse was a
new practice, and therefore more or less uncanny:
and the first traces of this practice are found in the
lerremare of N. Italy—ztan, before the migration south-
ward of peoples afterwards to become Latins.1 (3)
In some mysterious connection with Diana was a
divine figure known as Virbius. Here Servius gives
us his solitary bit of help: “ Re vera autem, Virbius
est numen coniunctum Dianae, ut Matri Deum Atys,
Minervae Ericthonius, Veneri Adonis.'' Whether this
comes out of Servius’ own head or not, it was a
natural and reasonable guess, though his analogies,
being all Greek, are of no use for an investigator of
Italian religion: but even in Italy we find ‘¹ conjunc-
tions'' of male and female “numina,'' which I have
tried to explain elsewhere.2

Now on these simple facts of a cult we find, as so
often in Roman literature, a Greek tale engrafted, and
in this case the explanation is simple; to explain the

² See Appendix iii. in my ‘⁶ Roman Religious Experience.''
But in the examplcs there examined, tho female “numina”
are merely functional qualifications of tho male ones: hore
Diana scenis the more important of the two.
