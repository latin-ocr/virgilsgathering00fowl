Virgil's “Gathering of the Clans”

ing, as containing the earliest mention of the legend
of Caeculus, about whom Servius has more to tell us,
though hardly ot more value-ag, how after the
foundation he exhibitecl games, to which the neigh-
bouring cities were invited; how he proclaimed him-
self son of Vulcan the fire-god; and how sceptics
were convinced by the sudden appearance of fire
hovering about them. Virgil says nothing of the
virgin-birth of Caeculus,1 of which Servius tells us—
viZ.‚ that he was born of the virgin sister of the two
brethren of Praeneste, and the fite-god in the form of
a spark which leapt on her from the hearth. The
same type of story was told of the birth of Servius
Tullius, and even os the Roman twins, if we can
accept the evidence of a mysterious writer, Proma-
thion‚ quoted by Plutarch in his “Life os Romulus‚”
chap. ii., but never once mentioned by any other
author.

These stories have been seized upon by the in-
genious author of the “ Golden Bough,'' and brought
together to support a theory that “the old Latin
kings were commonly supposed to be sons of the fire-
god by a morta] mother.''2 Strange to say, in spite
of all his vast collections of legend and ritual‚ Sir
J. G. Frazer is quite unable to parallel these stories

1 “Volcano genitum pecora inter agrestia regem, Inven-

tumque focis omnis quem credidit aetas.'' Pecora agrestia
seems only to mean that there was no city on the lofty
pastures of Praeneste when Caeculus was born.
