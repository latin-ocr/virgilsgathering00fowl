object in his own way, but the method is in the main
the same: the secret is in the skilful selection of

these magnificent fiends, Moloch, Chemosh, Dagon,
and the rest, and he cannot halt as yet. With the
words, “All these and more came fiocking,” he
braces himself for a new effort, and launches into the
full diapason of overwhelming organ sound. We
fairly forget that these are the hosts of the Devil
fighting against the will of God, as we almost forget,
at the close of the seventh Aeneid‚ that Rome and
Aeneas were in the hands of Fate for the good of
mankind. But I will return to this subject for a
moment when we have finished our task.

Before Ι end this introductory note, Ι wish to draw

his “Aeneidea,” when about to deal with Virgil’s
pageant.1 I have the greatest reverence for Dr.
Henry as a critic, for he is always interesting and in-
structive even where, as in this case (so it seems to
me) he is manifestly in the wrong; and I have fol-
lowed his comments caresully, as will be seen through—
