Virgil’s “ Gathering of the Clans''

boundary, of the Roman city: it was perhaps wild
pasture ground belonging to the people of the Pala-
tine, until it became the home of the “ plebs '' and of
the worships of a new population.l

Virgil paints Aventinus as parading his war-
chariot “per gramina,'' and connects him with the
legend of Cacus, to be recounted in the next book,
by making him the son of the conqueror of that mon-
ster and a priestess Rhea, about whom it is better
not to speculate. If we stop at line 663, there is
nothing in all this to trouble us; but if we go on to
read the next six lines as relating to the same man
and his followers, we are at once in difficulties. The
word “gerunt,'' as we have already noticed, has no
subject, and thus misled Dr. Henry into giving the
whole pageant a politica] meaning. In line 665 the
men are armed “veru Sabello '',· but the Aventine had
no sort of connection with the Sabines. ln the next
line, if we still take these lines as a description of
Aventinus, we suddenly find that he has got down
from his chariot, and wears a new and savage fight-
ing garb, which is surely inconsistent with the courtly
mien of one who was just now showing off his splen-
did horses (satus Hercule pulchro pulcher Aven-
tinus):

‘⁶ ipse pedeS, tegimen torquens immane leonis,

terribili impexum saeta cum dentibus albis
indutus capiti.'’
