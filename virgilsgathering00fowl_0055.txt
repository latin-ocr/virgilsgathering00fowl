Virgil's “ Gathering of the Clans ''

I do not believe that Virgil would have written
these six lines of description, the portrait of a savage
chieftain in war-paint, to mark the hero of a hill on
the site of Rome, and within a stone’s throw of the
city of the civilized Evander, to be described in the
next book. I will therefore write them here as fol-
lowing on the description of Ufens, and leave it to
the reader to decide whether or no they may be
thought to belong there:

“ et te montosae misere in praelia Nursae,
Ufens, insignem fama et felicibus armis,
horrida praecipue cui gens adsuetaque multo
venatu nemorum, duris Aequicola glebis.
Armati terram exercent semperque recentis
convectare iuvat praedas et vivere rapto.
pila manu saevosque gerunt in bella dolones,
et tereti pugnant mucrone veruque Sabello.
Ipse pedeS, tegimen torquens immane leonis,
terribili impexum saeta cum dentibus albis
indutus capiti, sic regia tecta subibat,
horridus Herculeoque umeros innexus amictu.’'

The last two of these lines, Ι confess, are still far
from clear to my mind, and suggest unfinished work-
manship. “Sic regia tecta subibat,'’ what can this
mean? If it is the palace of Latinus that he enters,

of the fore-limbs are cut away. A hole for the warrior's
head is made in the dorsal line a little behind the skin of
the head, which is flattened out and hangs over the chest‚

. . while the skin of back, flanks, and hind limbs, in one
large flap, covers the back and hind parts of the warrior as
far as the bend of the knees.’'
