Virgil's “Gathering of the Clans”

taboo on horses someone introduced the horse-legend
of Hippolytus, which seems to have been a favourite in
Italy. (Virgil na'i‘vely breaks the taboo by making
Virbius the younger drive his chariot to the war.) This
legend, for religious purposeS, we must leave out of
account altogether. It does not in the least help us
to the nature of Virbius or his relation to Diana.

A few years ago one might have left the matter
here: but a great British wizard, “felici comptus
oliva,” a friendly Umbro, who uses his powers with-
out malignity, has worked wonders with Virbius and
his belongings. In the last edition of the “Golden
Bough,'' a summary of these wonders will be found
in vol. 1'., p. 40 ff. I will not now do more than
express my gratitude to Virbius and the author of
that wonderful work for combining to build up a
treasure-house of anthropological knowledge admired
and revered by all the world of learning. But at the
same time Ι would draw attention to a few words in
the preface to the last two volumes of the great work,
which will serve to caution us in our enthusiasm for
its theories, and put us on our guard in the treat-

ment of details like this of Virbius ;
“ lt is the fate of theories to be washed away like

children's castles of sand by the rising tide of know-
ledge, and I am not so presumptuous as to expect or
desire for mine an exemption from the common lot.
I hold them all very lightly‚ and have used them
chiefly as convenient pegs on which to hang my col—

lections of facts.’'
