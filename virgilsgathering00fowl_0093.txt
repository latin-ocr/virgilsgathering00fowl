rather than toil that should equip him for his
task. Line upon line he goes through with his
work, and often word upon word, unconsciously
blunting the edge of his mind, and dulling the
sensibility of his ear. The Teutonie mind has
many valuable qualities‚ but we may doubt if it
readily apprehends the true inward poetic value of
words and phrases in Virgil; and if that apprehen-
sion be absent, the result often is that the Aeneid
as a whole fails to appeal to it. Mommsen was
never really moved by Virgil, I think, though he was
keenly sensitive to some Latin and Italian poetry.
Niebuhr is reported to have said in a lecture that it
had never occurred to him to place Virgil among
Roman poets of the first order! He added that our
poor poet mistook his vocation, which was really that
of a lyric poet. “It is sad to think that his mistake‚
the work which is his most complete failure, has been
so much admired by posterity.'' “The Aeneid is a
complete failure: it is unhappy from beginning to
end.''1 But let us hope that the historian was mis—
reported by some improbus anser sitting at his feet
in the lecture-room at Bonn.
