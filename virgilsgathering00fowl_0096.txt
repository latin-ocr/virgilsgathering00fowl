Virgil's “ Gathering of the Clans”

The “turba matrum ’' gazes upon Camilla as she
sets out ε

“attonitis inhians animis ut regius ostro
velet honos levis humeros, ut fibula crinem
auro internectat, Lyciam ut gerat ipsa pharetram
et pastoralem praefixa cuspide myrtum.‘’

and with these lines the pageant comes to a fitting

and beautiful end.1
I said at the beginning that I should return to

Milton and his ending, which is simple and quiet
enough, and leaves us almost cold among the myths
of Titan and his “enormous brood.'' But the chill

and with a most happy touch Virgil makes them mark her
dress as well as her weapons—her purple mantle, and the
fibula that fastens her hair.

1 It is hard to believe that any editor should have sug-
gested that the episode about the infancy of Camilla in
xi. 532 ff· was originally intended to follow these lines; but
Conington, in his note on xi. 537, tells us that Peerlkamp
thought so, supposing that the original editors, Tucca and
Varius, placed it where it is now. No doubt its position in
the eleventh book is at first sight surprising, and as Heinze
remarks (Virgil's ‘⁴ Epische Technik,'' p. 409 ff), it is an
exception to the poet’s habit of steady and uninterrupted
narration. Ι believe myself that it was inserted there, per-
haps after the complction of the book, to relieve the monotony
of the battle scenes, to take the reader's mind back to the
woodland and its wild inhabitants. But by no artistic mind
could it ever have been destined to follow this first beautiful
glimpse of the warrior maiden. (Peerlkamp it was of whom
Orelli said that ‘⁴ Horatium ex Horatio ipso expulit.’' See
Sir John Sandys in “Companion to Latin Studies,‘’ see.

1289.)
