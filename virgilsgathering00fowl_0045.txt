Virgil’s “ Gathering of the Clans ’²

for that reason a Roman poet might use her with a
fair amount of license. We used of course to think of
her as the wife of Jupiter, and my distinguished friend,
the author of the “Golden Bough,'' still, l believe,
holds this opinion. But Roman gods did not have
wives in the proper sense of that word, and Juno in
the great Capitoline temple was no more the wife of
Jupiter than her colleague Minerva. It used to be
thought, on no good evidence at all, that the Flamen
and Flaminica Dialis were priest and priestess of
Jupiter and Juno; but it is now recognized that both
served Jupiter only.1 There is, in fact, hardly any-
thing to connect the two deities together except
Homer and the wilful identification of Hera and
Juno.

Rid your mind of this identification, and you will
recognize the poet's right to turn Juno to any account
he pleases. Remember also that she was the repre·
sentative of the female principle at Rome: that
women thought of their Juno as men of their Genius.
Emphatically we may say that in the Aeneid she
represents the feminine temper, or at least some
aspects of it which were well known in the last cen-
tury B.C. Dr. Glover has rightly pointed out that
she also in the poem stands for a false idea of empire.
“Fate has decreed that one people shall rule the
world; she prefers another, and she tries conclusions
with Fate. Aeneas, as the agent of Fate, suffers.'' ²
