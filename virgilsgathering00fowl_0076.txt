Virgil's ‘⁸ Gathering of the Clans'’

have no doubt they are—Salii that is of the local
type—the staves they carry, with knobs at each end,
are much too long to be held in the middle and used
like kettledrum-sticks. So, too, the Roman pilum,
which Virgil kneW, was much too long to have its
meta] point rattled against the shield: it was about
six feet in length and meant for hurling.

Yet Virgil clearly, here and elsewhere, imagines the
shields struck with something: “sanguineus Mavors
clipeo increpat ’³ (xii. 332), which (as Conington
points out on viii. 3) is imitated by Silius, xii. 683: 1
Turnus, too, in viii. 3, “impulit arma,” to {righten the
enemy and rouse the spirits of his own men. What
was it that they did to make an exhilarating noise?
Perhaps the sword was used: perhaps the centre of
the spear, held in the right hand, was rattled against
the shield in the left.

Lines 723-743—“ Samnites of Campania '':

Again, clearly for purposes of contrast‚ Virgil
turns southward to the Oscan peoples; but he is going
to return immediately (again for the sake of con-
trast) to the mountains of central Italy. These lines

 

subject has been dismissed by Cirilli, ‘⁸ Les Pretres Danseurs
de Rome‚” p. 953 cf. Mrs. Strong· in J.R.S.. 1914, p. 150. The
Salii did not carry a sword; but the real warrior did, and
may well have used it to make a noise at the beginning of
a fight.

¹ Silius as usual elaborates the operation: ⁴⁴ Rursus in
arma vocat trepidos, clipeoque tremendum Increpat, atque
armis imitatur murmura caeli.’'
