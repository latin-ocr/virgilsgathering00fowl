TRANSLATION

(By J ames Rhoades)

THERE was a wonted rite in Latium’s realm
Hesperian. holy held from age to age
By Alba’s cities, as to-day by Rome,
Earth's mightiest‚ when they rouse the god of war
To battle, whether against Getic foes
Intent to launch amain the dolorous fray,
Or Arabs, or HyrcanianS, or to march
On India's sons, or track the morning-star,
And from the Parthian their lost standards claim.
There are twin gates of War—so named and known-ff
By holy fear and terror of fell Mars
Made venerable: a hundred brazen bolts
Constrain them, and the eternal strength of iton.
Nor Janus on the threshold slacks his guard.
Here, be the fathers’ will on battle bent,
The Consul in Quirinal robe arrayed
And Gabine cincture, the harsh-grinding valves
Himself nubam, himself invokes the fray,
Then all the war-host follow, and with one throat
The brazen clarions blare their hoarse assent.
Now too on this wise was Latinus bidden
War to proclaim against the sons of Troy,
Unclose the sullen portals. From their touch
The sire recoiled, turned from the loathed task
Shrinking‚ and shrouded him in eyeless gloom.
