Virgil’s “ Gathering of the Clans‘'

students.1 Servius, he says, took the cream off the
word by saying that Ennius and Lucretius used
florens for anything that is nitidus, and that Virgil
followed them. “ No: ‘florere' is ἄνθειν, and both
words, like our own English ‘to bloom‚ to blow, to
flourish,’ preserve in their secondary and derived
meaning the allusion to their primary smell, if I may
use the metaphor, of the flower-garden.'' < Cp. Plautus
Pers. v, i. 23, where Toxilus presents a garland to
Lemniselenis with the words, Do lianc tibi florentem
florenti.) It is especially used to express (a) the
fresh, blooming appearance of youth and beauty, as
in Ciris 435 :
“ me non florentes aequali corpore Nymphae
non metus incendens potuit retinere deorum '’

(op. ΟΥ. Met. ix. 435); (bi the gay and blooming ap-
pearance conferred by new clothes or new arms, as
Accius, quoted by Nonius (p. 808, Lindsay‘s edition) :
‘⁶ aere atque ferro fervere, igni insignibus
florere .·’'
(cp. Claudian, Cons Honor. 133); (c) to any other

kind of blooming appearance, as lighted lamps,
precious stones ; Lucretius, iv. 452:

“ bina lucernarum florentia lumina flammis;¹¹

and v. 1441:

“ tum mare velivolum florebat pztppibu5.¹' '²
