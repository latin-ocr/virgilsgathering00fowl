Virgil’s “Gathering of the Clans ''

F irst, the sixth book, and especially the prophetie
close of it, has left the reader in full conviction of the
religious destiny of Aeneas and Rome, and this de-
finite impression cannot possibly be obliterated by
any amount of Italian heroism in the rest of the
poem.² Again, in this seventh book, before the
pageant opens, it is made plain that this is a bad
war, stirred up by the ever unscrupulous Juno-Hera
(of whom more directly) through an offensive and
grisly agent, the F ury Allecto: hence

‘⁴ saevit amor ferri et scelerata insania belli:‘'

and
“ ilicet infandum cuncti contra omina bellum

contra fata deum perverso numine poscunt.’‘

And when in the following lines Latinus is forced to
give way with a deep sigh for rest, this sigh is ac-
companied by a fierce curse on the head of Turnus :

‘⁴ te Turne nefas, te triste manebit
supplicium, votisque deos venerabere seris.’'

A Roman of Augustus’ day would think of other bad
wars and another reckless leader, Antony.

Yet the Italian spirit is skilfully safeguarded, as
we shall see as we follow the pageant. Cities, rivers,
local deities, and many local touches and legends,
combine to delight the Italian municipalis, who will
be reminded of the Homeric catalogue he read in

² The keynotc is sounded strongly again just before the
pageant begins: ‘¹ Mos erat Hesperio in Latio, quem pro-

tinus urbes Albanae coluere sacrum, nunc maxima rerum
Roma colit. . . .'' (601 ff..)
