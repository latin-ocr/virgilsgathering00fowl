Virgil’s “ Gathering of the Clans”

across their shoulders,· and were themselves mistaken
for a band of raiders, causing a momentary panic.

Lines 7 50—760—“ Umbro, the priestly snake-
charmer of the Marsi '':

‘⁵ Quin et Marruvia venit de gente sacerdos
fronde super galeam ct felici comptus oliva
Archippi regis missu, fortissimus Vmbro,
vipereo generi et graviter spirantibus hydris
spargere qui somnos cantuque manuque solebat,
mulcebatque iras et morsus arte levabat.
sed non Dardaniae medicari cuspidis ictum
evaluit neque euni iuvere in vulnera cantus
somniferi et Marsis quaesitae montibus herbae.
te nemus Angitiae, vitrea te Fucinus unda,
te liquidi flevere lacus.’‘

These lines are of peculias interest. Umbro, the
Marsian, snake-charmer and master of medicine,
stands out among all the figures in the pageant ; and
the eye of the spectator lingers on him, for the poet
tells us that none of his arts could save him in the
fighting to corne. He wears the olive on his helmet,
the olive so often called felix, and associated with the
messengers and the arts of peace ;1 but it will avail him
nothing.

1 Diels, ‘⁴ Sibyllinische Blssitterss’ p. 120, has some inter-
esting remarks on the use of the “mild, peace-suggesting
olives He goes perhaps too sar in contrasting the
“ heavenly '’ bay (U laurus ”) with the ¹* earthly ” olive. But

his citation of Isyllos of Epidaurus (Wilamowitz “ Isyll.‚”
p. (3) is interesting here ε
