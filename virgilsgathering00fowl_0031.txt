Virgil's “Gathering of the Clans

And Circe’s ridge; over whose fields enthroned
Rules Jove of Anxur, and Feronia sits
Rejoicing in her greenwood; where outstretched
Lies the black marsh of Satura, and where
Along the valley-bottoms winds his way

Cold Ufens, till he plunges in the deep.

To crown them comes Camilla, Volscian-bred,
Heading her horse-troop, squadrons bright with brass,
A warrior-maid, her woman's hands unused
To loom or basket os: Minerva's wool,

But strong to bide the battle, and on foot
Outrace the breezes: she might e'en have sped
Over the unlopped harvest-blades, nor bruised
The tendet ears in running, or have skimmed
Mid-ocean, poised upon the billows’ sweH,

Nor in the surges dipped her fiying feet.

At her, astonied youths and matrons all

From house and field throng gazing, as she goes.
Agape with wonder at the royal pomp

Of purple draped about her shoulders smooth,
Her tresses intertwined with clasp of gold——

To mark the Lycian quiver that she bears,
And pastoral wand of myrtle tipped with steel.
