Virgil's “ Gathering of the Clans ''

This idea of empire is false, not only because it is
backed up by a great female numen, whose temper is
irreconcilable with the large masculine benevolence of
Jupiter, but because, with the aid of that numen, it
is embodied in a woman, Dido, foreshadowing the
beautiful dangerous queen of Virgil's own day. Juno
in the Aeneid is well worth careful study ; even the first
fifty lines of book i.‚ well weighed (as seldom hap-
pens), will do much to help us. At the outset of his
poem, with all the emphasis he can use, Virgss asso-
ciates her in interest—an interest perverse in the eyes
of all Romans—with the most deadly enemy Rome
ever had to meet, and with the mythical queen of
Carthage, the Cleopatra of his poeti-'cal fancy.
Dido’s tender arts were for Aeneas “Iunonia
hospitia,'' and would bring to mind the equally
dangerous blandishments of the Egyptian queen. ¹
This use of Juno in the Aeneid was perhaps made
easier and more natural because, as a goddess, she
belonged rather to Rome's early enemies than to
Rome herself. She was a familiar figure in many or
most of the cities mentioned in the pageant—on the
Aventine, at Tibur Praeneste and Falerii, in southern
Etruria (as Uni), and in Campania? But at Rome,
strange to say, she had no great local name and fame
in early times, and thus no feelings could be hurt if a
Roman poet made her the deadly enemy of Rome.
