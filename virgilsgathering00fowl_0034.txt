searched Mommsen’s “History of Rome '’ for some
allusion to their homes, and treasured up the refer—

paese,” they would exclaim‚ as he travelled through
their town in later days.1 The Homeric “ cata-
logue‘'2 doubtless had an object of the same kind,
but it is far more a catalogue than a pageant, and it
ends with a list of what we should now call “ enemy
cities.'' Its psychological effect, I imagine, was
inferior to that of Virgil’s picture, if only because the
Roman poet set himself to support with all his gifts
the definite Italian policy of Augustus,3 at a time
when Italy's need for national satisfaction and hope
were greater than they had ever yet been.

This, Ι think, was the poet’s primary motive‚ but
in the execution he was confronted by serious diffi-
culties which made his task a complex one. We

first learnt what this meant. I may refer to his “ Outlines
of Roman History‚” p. 411, for a brief account of it. Prob-
ably Julius had first suggested the idea that Rome and Italy
taken together were henceforward to be the centre of
civilization.
