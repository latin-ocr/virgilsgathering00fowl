Virgil’s “ Gathering of the Clans’'

have arisen out of Georg. ii. 224-225 :

“ talem dives arat Capua et vicina Vesevo

Virgil’s Nersae: if it ever had been a city, it had
become a vicus in his and Pliny’s time.

I have already suggested that the lines 664-669 may
belong here—226„ after line 749. And for “Armati

the Classical Review, May, 1914. Tristram and his
friends, travelling among the wild tribes to the east
of Jordan, came suddenly upon a population engaged
in husbandry in the fields, wille their gans slzmg
