Virgil's “Gathering of the Clans''

which Dr. Henry explains as an open expression of
contempt for the crowd. With all my admiration for
Dr. Henry‚ I am convinced that he is quite wrong
here. There are a good many signs in book vii. of
unfinished workmanship, though the highly finished
parts are as fine as any in the whole poem; and I
think this may very well recl<on as one of these signs,
unless indeed, as I shall presently suggest, these
lines are not in their proper place. At any rate I
cannot persuade myself that Virgil left out the sub-
ject to “gerunt '' in order to pour contempt on the
Italian rank and file. It is curious to find Dr. Henry
going far to refute his own argument by remarking that
Milton, though democrat and regicide, follows Virgil’s
method and not Homer's. If Milton did so, and
made “the promiscuous crowd ’' stand all aloof, we
may be sure that he did so for artistic reasons, not
for politica] ones. He had no use for the promis—
cuous crowd, except, when his list of the chiefs is
ended, to send up, at sight of the unfurling of the
imperial ensign of hell,

‘¹ A shout that tore Heaven's concave‚ and beyond,
Frighted the reign of Chaos and old Night‚’'

and thus to introduce a passage of such sublime
splendour as is hardly to be found either in Homer
or Virgil. The old Puritan was a consummate artist
and knew very well where his artistic interest lay;
this was his compass all through his long voyage,
and beyond all doubt it was Virgil’s too,
