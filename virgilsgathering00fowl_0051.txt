Virgil’s “ Gathering of the Clans '³

Virgil emphasizing this in the Augustam age, in spite
of the very different ideas of his great predecessor
Lucretius. Mezentius did things that the gods could
not put up with, because they violatcd the established
rules of right and wrong.

Henry aptly refers to another passage of our poet,
this time in book i.1 Ilioneus, Aeneas' messenger,
having demanded justice of Dido, having required
her to deal with him and the Trojans according to
the immutable principles of justice, reminds her of
the sanction of the gods, and warns her not to despise
that sanction, non temnere divos:

“-si genus humanum et mortalia temnitis arma,
at sperate deos memores fandi atque nefandi,”

where, if Ι am not inistaken, Virgil is practically
inventing a new genitive for “fas’' and “nefas,” ΞΑ,
right and wrong in the sight of the gods.·-’

Lines 655 ffi——Aventinus ε

“ Post hos insignem palma per gramina currum
victoresque ostentat equos satus Hercule pulchro
pulcher Aventinus, clipeoque insigne paternum

¹ Lines 542-543. Cp. 603-605.

² The view taken by virgil was emphatically put by
Cicero in the previous generation: Nat. Deor. i. 2, 3,
Haud scio an, pietate adversus deos sublata, fides etiam et
societas generis humani et una excellentissima virtus,
iustitia, tollatur. Cp. dc Off. iii. 28; Fin. iv. 1*1; and other
passages quoted by Mayor in his note on Nat. Deor„ loc. cit.
Servius tells us that by fandum et infandum the poet meant·
iustitia and iniustitia.
