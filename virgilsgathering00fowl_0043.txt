Virgil's “ Gathering of the Clans '’

ii. 49 the unlucky archway of the Porta Carmentalis
was the right—hand one, we may perhaps guess that
the army went out through the left-hand one, return-
ing by the other, which would then also be on their
left hand.

Mars, so far as we know, had nothing to do with
this gate, and his name is here, I think, hardly more
than the synonym for war, with which all Romans
were by Virgil’s time familiar. Janus is rightly
presented as the spirit guarding the gate, not as
a deity to whom it served as temple. We know of
no sacrifice performed at this gate, nor any rite that
could suggest its use as a jamnon the sacrifice of a
ram to this numen on January 9 took place in the
Regia.

So far Virgil is historically right. But when
he goes on to describe the opening of the gate,
he carries out the unhistorical idea of which he has
already given us a hint in the lines quoted above,
that it was normally closed, fastened in fact by bolts
and bars, a hundred of them, so that the strength of
a mortal king or consul could hardly force them
open. Virgil knew well enough that till his own age,
the era of the Pax Augusta, the Roman Gates of
WVar had only once been closed ; but he could afford
to defy tradition here, partly because he is not writ—
ing of historical Rome but of the city of Latinus, and
mainly because he had already, near the beginning of
his poem, made Jupiter foretell the day when the
Gates would be perpetually closed, and the unholy
spirit of strife (juror impius) would be imprisoned
