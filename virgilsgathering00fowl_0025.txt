Virgil’s “Gathering of the Clans''

Halaesus next, of Agamemnon’s stock,

Foe to the name of Troy, yokes steed to car,
And whirls a thousand warlike tribes along
To fight for Turnus, men who till with hoe
The wine-blest Massic region, or sent forth
From their high hills by the Auruncan sires,
Or Sidicine low-dwellers hard at hand3
Comers from Cales, and who dwell beside
'Volturnus‘ shoaly river, and with these
The rough Saticulam, and the Oscan band ;
Smooth-polished clubs for missiles, 'tis their wont
With a tough thong to fit them; the left arm
A leathern target shields ; curv'd swords they bear
For close encounter.

Nor must thou depart
Unhonoured of our song, O Oebalus,
Whom, as foll< tell, the nymph Sebethis bare
To Telon, when now full of years he ruled
The Teleboic realm of Capreae.
But with his sire’s domain wax'd ill-content,
E'en then the son was curbing ’neath his sway
The wide Sarrastian peoples, and the plains
ssy Sarnus washed, folk that in Rufrae dwell
And Batulum and Celemna's furrowed fields‚
And those on whom the battlements look down
Of apple-boughed Abella. These were wont
ln Teuton wise long darts to hurl amain:
Peeled cork-tree bark for head—gear, their slight shields
Are glittering brass, and glittering brass their swords.

And thee too, Ufens, from her mountain-perch

Nersae sent forth to battle, fame-renowned,
