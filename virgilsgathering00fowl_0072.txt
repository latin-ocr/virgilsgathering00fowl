Virgil's “Gathering of the Clans '’

beautiful1 {“ceu quondam nivei,''etc.) : it owes nothing
to Apollonius Rhodius, though Conington tells us

that it does. The second, “Nec quisquam aeratas
acies,” etc., adds nothing, and is, in fact, an awkward

translation from Apollonius, iv. 238 ff. How it got
into its position in the passage I cannot of course
explain, but that it has no business there Ι am clear.
The best guess I can make is that it was written as ·
an alternative, and embodied in the text by the first
editors, who would not wish to excise it altogether.

Let me add that those who may wish to know what
the ancients thought and wrote about swans will find
it all in Prof. Darcy Thompson's “ Glossary of Greek
Birds‚” p. 104 ff: a book of real and even astonishing
learning, but far too little known and used, especially
on the Continent.

Lines 706 ff.—“ The Sabines of the mountains'’:

‘⁴ Ecce Sabinorum prisco de sanguine magnum
agmen agens Clausus magnique ipse agminis instar,
Claudia nunc a quo diffunditur et tribus et gens

 

1 Cp. Iliad, ii. 459: a simile perhaps more true to fact
than Virgil's, oi· at least more exact in detail, but hardly so
beautiful. It reminds me of what could be seen from the train
window of the birds in the marshes of the Cayster, while
we were travelling to Ephesus from Smyrna and back again
some years ago. Here it is :

Τῶν δ’ ὥς τ’ ὀρνίθων πετεηνῶν ἔθνεα πολλὰ,
Χηνῶν ἢ ’γεράνων ἢ κύκνων δουλιχοδείρων,

Ἀσίῳ ἐν λειμῶνι, Καϋστρίου ἀμφὶ ῥέεθρα,

’Ἑνθα καὶ ἔνθα ποτῶνται, ἀγαλλόμενα πτερύγεσσιν.
Κλαγγηδὸν προκαθιζόντων, σμαραγεῖ δέ τε λειμὼν,
’Ὡς τῶν ἔθνεα πολλὰ νεῶν, κ.τ.λ.
