Virgil's “Gathering of the Clans”

It may be worth while also to look at xi. 390,
because there the pause occurs in the middle of the
impassioned rhetoric of Turnus against Drances,
just to allow one bitter taunt to sink in, before he turns
to take up another point of Drances' speech :

‘⁸ Imus in adversos—quid cessas? an tibi Mavors
ventosa in lingua pedibusque fugacibus istis
semper erit?
pulsus ego? aut quisquam merito, foedissime, pulsum
arguet. . . .”

Ι think I may fairly assume that anyone who
examines these passages, to help him in judging of
the one more particularly under consideration, will
not fail to conclude that the second bird-simile is

absolutely inadmissible after the hemistich.

,βψ Since this Appendix was written, ΜΓ. Mackail has
published some valuable remarks on Virgil’s hemistichiae in
the Classical Review, December, 1915, p. 226.
