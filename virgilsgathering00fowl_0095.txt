Virgil's ‘⁶ Gathering of the Clans

“Florentes aere '' is therefore not “ splendentes, fulgentes
aere,” as Servius and some German commentators ex-
plain it, and as he describes Pallas and his men in
viii. 593,“fulgentes aere'' but in the very different sense
oj blooming, charming with “ aes.” [I would add that
while words like “fulgentes ” or “ splendentes '' give
the effect produced without a hint of what produces it,
“florentes ’¹ suggests life and beauty‚ young life and
fresh beauty, as the organic cause] Thus, he says,
it is specially applicable to women, and in the
Aeneid it is used only of Camilla and her troops,
here and in xi. 433, though in Georg. iv. 563 he uses
it of himself in his youth:

‘⁴ illo Vergilium me tempore dulcis alebat-
Parthenope studiis florentem ignobilis oti,''

thus suggesting that their “ florere,” when coupled with
bronze, their bloom, their finery, was not the ordinary
bloom or finery of their seX, but the manly martial
bloom or finery of ‘¹ aes ''; [to which I would add that
the bronze armour seems to call for a new word to
express it when worn by beautiful and youthful
women]1 But if the reader of these pages can come
by Henry's ‘'Aeneidea,’' let him ponder well pp. 616754„
and judge for himself whether he has not here found
another example of “all the charm of all the Muses
often flowerz'ng in a lonely word.’'

¹ That the immediate companions, if not the troops as a
whole, of Camilla, were women, is proved by xi. 655 ff. .· “ At
circum lectae comites, etc.'' I think it is also suggested by
the fact that the crowd which gazes on her as she rides away
to the war (vii. 812) is largelycomposed of women (⁸⁸ matres '')‚
