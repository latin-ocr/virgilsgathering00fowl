Virgil‘s “ Gathering of the Clans”

The Phoebus—born. But Trivia of her Gracc

In a dim dwelling hides Hippolytus,

To nymph Egeria and her grove consigned,

Alone, obscure, in woods of Italy

With altered name, as Virbius to live on.

Whence too, from Trivia’s shrine, and hallowed groves

Horn-hoofed steeds are banished, for that they,

Frighted by ocean-monsters, on the shore

Flung car and warrior. But the son no less

His fiery steeds along the level plain

Was driving, and rushed charioted to war.
Himself‚ too, Turnus, of surpassing mould,

Amid the foremost moving, arms in hand,

By a whole head o'ertops them3 his proud helm,

Tressed with a triple plume, Chimaera bears

Out-breathing from her jaws Aetnean fires,

The madlier raging with more baleful flames

As deeplier the red field with carnage ran.

But his smooth shield lo with lifted horns

In gold emblazoned, now with hair o'ergrown,

Now turned to heifer, a stupendous sign,

And Argus, the maid's warder, and therewith‚

His flood outpouring from a graven urn,

Sire Inachus, Behind the hero comes

A cloud of footmen, and o'er all the plain

The shielded ranks are thickening, Argive men,

The Auruncan musters with the Rutule ranks;

And old Sicani, the Sacranian host

And gay-shielded Labici3 who thy lawns,

O Tiber, and Numicius’ sacred shore

Till, or with ploughshare tame the Rutule heights
