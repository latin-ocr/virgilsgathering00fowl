Virgil’s “ Gathering of the Clans'’

In measured time they march and chant their king:
As snow-white swans that, through the liquid clouds
From food returning, utter forth their full
Long·throated strains. The stream and Asia's fen
Afar ring smitten. [Nor had one deemed them there
A mail-clad army blent in vast array,
But rather of hoarse birds an airy cloud,
That from the deep mid-ocean shoreward ply]

Lo! Clausus of old Sabine blood, who leads
A mighty host, himself a host in might !
From whom the Claudian tribe and elan to-day‚
Since Rome was with the Sabine shared, spreads wide
Through Latium: and along with them the vast
Cohort of Amiternum and old-world
Quirites, all Eretum’s folk, and they
Of olive-rife Mutusca; men who throng
Nomentum’s city and the Rosean plain
Hard by Velinus: who the rugged rocks
Of Tetrica, and Mount Severus hold,
Casperia‘s town, and Foruli, and where flows
Himella’s stream; who drink of Tiber's wave
And Fabaris, or whom chilly Nursia sends,
With Horta's squadrons and the Latian tribes,
And they whom Allia, evil-boding name,
Parts with dividing current: numberless
As billows that on Libya's sea-floor roll,
When fierce Orion sets in wintry wave,
Or thick as clustering corn-ears, that beneath
The young sun ripen, or on Hermus' plain,
‘Or Lycia's yellowing fields. Their bucklers clang,
And the earth quakes for terror as they tread.
