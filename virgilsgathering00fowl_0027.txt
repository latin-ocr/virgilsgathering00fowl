Virgil’s “Gathering of the Clans'’

And fortunate in war, whose Aequian foll<
On their stiff clods are rugged beyond all,
And to hard hunting in the woods inured.
ln arms they task the furrow, and evermore
Amass new plunder, and by rapine live.

Ay, and a priest of race Marruvian came,
His head with garland of rich olive dight,
By King Archippus sent, Umbro the brave,
Who on the viper's brood and water—snakes
Of baneful boeath, with charm of voice and touch
Shed slumber, and assuaged their wrath, his craft
Their bites allaying. But stroke of Dardan spear
To heal he skilled not, nor his slumberous charms
Availed against their wounds, nor herbs with care
Culled on the Marsian mountains Wept for thee
Angitia’s grove, for thee the glassy wave
Of Fucinus, the crystal pools for thee.

There Virbius to the war in beauty strode,
Son of Hippolytus, whom in flower of fame
His mother sent, Aricia ; nursed he was
In groves Egerian round the humid shores,
Where Dian’s rich and gracious altar stands.
Ay, for Hippolytus, so runs the tale,
By stepdame's treachery done to death, and torn
By his scared steeds, to glut a sire’s revenge,
Came back to daylight and the air of heaven,
Called by the Healer's herbs and Dian's love,
Then wroth that mortal should from shades of hell
Rise to the light of life, the Almighty Sire
With his own levin-bolt to Stygian wave
Thrust down the findet of such craft and cure,
