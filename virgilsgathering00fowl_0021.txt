Virgil’s “Gathering of the Clans'’

Then brethren twain from Tibur’s hold, a foll<
Called from their brother's name Tiburtus, come,
Catillus and keen Coras, Argive youths.

First of the foremost, on they press, where darts
Throng thickest : as when from some tall mountain-top
Descend two cloud-born Cenum-S, Homole

Or snow-capped Othrys quitting with swift stride;
The mighty forest as they go gives place,

And with loud crash the thickets yield them way.

Nor lacked the founder of Praeneste's town,

King sprung from Vulcan 'mid the pasturing herds,
And by the fireside found, as every age

Hath deemed him—Caeculus. A rustic band
Spread wide attends him, those that dwell on steep
Praeneste’s height, or Gabian Juno’s fields,

Chill Anio, or the stream-dewed Hernic rocks-3
Whom rich Anagnia nurtureS, or whom thou,

Sire Amasenus. Arms they have not all,

Nor shield, nor sounding chariot. The more part
Sling bullets of blue lead. Some javelins twain
Brandish in hand, with tawny wolfskin cap

For head-gear: the left foot bare-soled they plant;
The other a raw bull’s hide sanda] sheathes.

Messapus, the steed-tamer‚ Neptune's child,

Whom none with fire, nor yet with steel, may quell.
Tribes long inert and ranks to battle strange

Calls suddenly to arms grasps sword once more.
These have Fescennine warriors in their host,

And Aequi of Falerium; these hold high

Soracte and Flavinian fields, the lake

And hill of Ciminus, and Capena’s groves.
