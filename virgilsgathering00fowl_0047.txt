Virgil’s “ Gathering of the Clans ''
Lines 629 ff.—“ The five ‘arsenals' ”2

‘⁴ quinque adeo magnae positis incudibus urbes
tela novant, Atina potens Tiburque superbum,
Ardea Crustumerique et turrigerae Antemnae.''

Then follows an account of the work done in these
cities. Why did Virgil name these cities as arsenals ?
Simply as important ones? But there were others
quite as important, and what we should naturally
look for is some tradition of. metal-working in these
centres: but of this Ι can find no trace, either in
history or archaeology. Recently Dr. Cirilli has
started a theory that the Salii. or dancing priest-
warriors of Mars, represent the introduction of metal-
working from Crete3l and is this were so it would be
quite like Virgil to select as his arsenals cities in which
Salii were an institution. But the only one of the
five where they are known to have existed is Tibur;
and in my opinion Dr. Cirilli’s theory is quite unneces-
sary as an explanation of the Salii, and inconsistent
with the evidence of archaeology‚ which proves that
metal-working came into central Italy from the north,
with the people of the terremare.2

Of the five towns, Crustumerium ancl Antemnae
were quite near Rome in the Tiber valley, and Tibur
not far off ; they may stand for arsenals of the
Latins and Aequi. Ardea was the chief town of
