Virgil's “ Gathering of the Clans'‘

it is full thirty miles away from that city, and one
would expect it to be mentioned later on, when we
come to Camilla and the Volsci (see xi. 547). But
Virgil evidently wishes to impress on his reader the
early greatness of Praeneste: for it was a great city
in his own time, and it is possible that he had some
personal reason for celebrating it. It was one of those
towns near Rome which Augustus praecipue fre-
quentavit, as Suetonius tells us (Aug. 72 and 82).²
The Praenestine troops are of course on foot, like
those of Tibur; their war-dress and equipment are
various. Whether the poet had any antiquarian
foundation for these we cannot very well knOW.
Long notes have been written about lines 689-690.—
Here the fact is oddly expoessed, but the meaning
is clear; these slingers‚ as they mostly were (“ pars
maxima glandes Liventis plumbi spargit ”), had the
left foot naked, while on the right they wore a boot.
And the reason is as plain as the meaning: a right-
handed man needs a left foot as free as possible, to
grip the ground as he discharges his missile. One
does not need the learning of Macrobius' note on this
passage to realise that simple fact, though in other
ways the note is valuable (Sat. V. 18, 13 ff..) If as he
says the Aetolians went into action with the left foot
bare, wc may guess that, like their neighbours the

¹ It is possible that Verrius Flaccus, who was tutor to the
grandsons of Augustus, was a native of Praeneste. At any
rate hc was intimateiy connected with it, as the author of
the ‘⁴ Fasti Praenestini,‘’ of which we still possess a consider-
able part. (See “ Roman Festivals,'’ p. 12.)
