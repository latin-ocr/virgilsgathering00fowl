Virgil’s “ Gathering of the Clans''

is only momentary ; in another moment we are saluted
by a peal of such magnificent sound as seems to lift
us right out of ourselves and beyond the reach of
even Homer and Virgil. I cannot resist the tempta—
tion to transcribe these lines :

“ All these and more came flocking; but with looks
Downcast and damp, yet such wherein appeared

Semblance of worth, not substance, gently raised
Their sainting courage and dispelled their fears:
Then straight commands that at the warlike sound
Of trumpets loud and clarions‚ be up-reared
His mighty standard. That proud honour claimed

Who forthwith from the glittering staff unfurled
The imperial ensign‚ which, full high advanced,
Shone like a meteor streaming to the wind,
With gems and golden lustre rich emblazed,
Seraphic arms and trophies; all the while
Sonorous metal blowing martial sounds;

At which the universal host upsent

A shout that tore Hell's concave, and beyond
Frighted the reign of Chaos and old Night.

All in a moment through the gloom were seen
Ten thousand banners rise into the air

With orient colours waving; with them rose

A forest huge of spears, and thronging helms
Appeared, and serried shields in thick array

Of depth immeasurable; anon they move

In perfect phalanx to the Dorian mood

Of flutes and soft recorders; such as raised
