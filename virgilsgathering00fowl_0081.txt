Virgil's “Gathering of the Clans”

The tradition and practice 01 snake-charming has
always been confined to the district 01 1116 Μ3151,
110111 which Umbro came; the shores 01 1116 “lacus
Fucinus‚'’ which has been drained in our own time,
and the hills overlooking it. The commentators tell
us that the art continued through Roman times, and l
need not reproduce their references: but what they
do not tell us is that it survived through the middle
ages, attached itself to a famous local saint, and is
by no means extinct at the present day. My
informant 15 Μ155 Μ3661011611, whose book on the
Abruzzi I have already quoted.1 She does not tell
us what species 01 snake 15 111115 treated by the Marsi3
but it 15 probably the Italian 101111 01 1116 60111111011
viper (Vipera aspis), with the harmless ringed snake
(Tropidonotus natrix), 1311111131· 10 115 311 111 England.

Quoting the historian 01 1116 Marsi, Muzio
Febonio, Miss Maedonell tells us that in 1116
parts about Lake Fucino, and especially about 1116
10015 01 Monte Penna, there is such an abundance 01
serpents that in the summer heat they are wont to
come out 01 1116 mountain and go down to the water,
and may be seen coiled up like bundles 01 vine twigs
on the stones, or testing on the rocky ledges above the
lake. Febonio also says 01 1115 own knowledge that
Don Paul Ciarallo, archpriest 01 Bisignano, 01 1116
old race 01 1116 Μ3151, had, with all his family, the
power 01 catching serpentS, and 01 curing their bites
merely with the saliva 01 1116 111011111. 2
