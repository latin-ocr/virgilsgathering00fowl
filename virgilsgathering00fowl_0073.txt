. Virgil's “Gathering ot the Clans ’'

per Latium, postquam in partem data Roma Sabinis.
una ingens Amiterna cohors priscique Quirites,
Ereti manus omnis oliviferaeque Mutuscae;

qui Nomentum urbem, qui Rosea rura Velini,

que Tetricae horrentis rupes montemque Severum
Casperiamque colunt Forulosque et flumen Himellae,
qui Tiberim Fabarimque bibunt, quos frigida misit
Nursia, et Ortinae classes populique Latini,
quosque secans infaustum interluit Allia nomen :
quam multi Libyco volvuntur marmore fluctus
saevus ubi Orion hibernis conditur undis,

vel cum sole novo densae torrentur aristae

aut Hermi campo aut Lyciae flaventibus arvis.

There is no need to trouble about Virgil's chrono—
logy. His Clausus is not the Clausus of Livy, ii. 16,
who migrated to Rome in 502 B.C., and founded the
gens and tribus Claudia, but an idealised epony-
mous ancestor of these, “ belonging to an age anterior
to the Romans: which indisputably agrees with the
spirit of the early ages” (Niebuhr, “ History of Rome,''
vol. i.‚ p. 560). In lines 708-709, Virgil seems to confuse
the original amalgamation of Palatine and Quirinal
settlements with the immigration of Clausus: but for
his purposes this is of no consequence.

The region to which he now transports us, the
Abruzzi of modern Italy, affords another variation on
his theme, and a good contrast with the last group
of warriors. The towns here are few and small,
Amiternum, Nomentum, Eretum, Nursia: there is no
great centre like Falerii. We are here almost in the
backbone of Italy, and hear the names of rivers and
mountains rather than of towns3 and the fighting
men are on foot‚ as we should expect of mountaineers.
