“ quem neque fas igni cuiquam nec sternere ferro,⁷’

where it is more important for us to bc clear that jas
here suggests the sacred personality of the ancient
kingship, than to waste time in trying to find out
what Virgil meant by ignis.2 Lastly, the warriors
who followed him sang of him as they marched in
rhythmical measure (aequali numero), where perhaps
Virgil is thinking· of the rhythmica] movements ac-
companying the singing of the Salii. However this
may be, Messapus must have been in some sense one

pacific policy he reminds us of Numa ; but now
