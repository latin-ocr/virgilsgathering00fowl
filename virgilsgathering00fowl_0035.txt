Virgil's “Gathering of the Clans”

summate skill, who could find no help in his Iliad.
Virgil had to hold firmly together the sympathies of
Romans and Italians. Someone may ask, where was
the difficulty? Surely they were by his time united
in feeling. No ; if that had really been so, Augustus’
policy would have been superfluous. Italy is not a
country that lends itself easily to unification, as
Italians know well at the present day; and only
twenty years before Virgil was born, the peoples of
centra] Italy had been engaged in deadly strife with
Rome, and had forced her to treat them as her equals.
The Italian policy of Augustus was in truth a new
one, and I have no doubt whatever that in this
episode Virgil believed himself to be aiding it.

Thus the poet might not too plainly treat his
Italians as the enemies of the Roman spirit and ern-
pire, nor on the other hand might he engage the
sympathy of his reader too absolutely for Aeneas
and the invaders :

“ dextrum Scylla latus, laevum implacata Charybdis
obsidet. . . ”

Let us see how he surmounts the difficulty, and
achieves the feat of keeping Rome and her solemn
destiny in our minds while he shows us the bloom
and vigour of Italy in a series of splendid pictures.1

¹ The difficulty was increased by the fact that Italy was
practically new ground for an epic poet. Interest in Italy
and the Italians must be roused ι here the old epic ground is
left behind, and the gathering of the clans is an old episode
in a new setting. On this point see Boissier‚ “ Promenades
Archaeologiques,” second series p. 261 ff.
