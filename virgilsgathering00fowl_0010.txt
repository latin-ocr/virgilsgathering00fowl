Preface

I have to thank my old friend Mr. James Rhoades

for his kind permission to use his excellent verse
translation of this part of the seventh book.

Ι have begun at line 601, where the supernatural
action ends, and man‘s “scelerata insania belli ’'
begins to rage. It was a bad war: a war against
the human agent of the heaven-god and the idea of
justice which he represented. Such a war was that
of Milton’s fallen angels : such in yet another sense is
that into which the great German people has plunged
Europe, rejoicing in its strength. lnscmo iuvat in-

dulgere labori.
