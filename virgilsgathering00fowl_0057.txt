Virgil's “Gathering of the Clans'’

the triumph was‚¹ then the dress and outfit of
the trimmhator were probably those of the old
Etruscan chieftain. It is commonly asserted (and I
have asserted it mysels) that these were simply
imitated from the statue of Jupiter in the ζ Etruscan)
temple on the Capitol.2 But the “ toga picta,” the face

face reddened with minium is no argument; it was used, as
it is still in many parts of the world, for producing certain
effects, religious or warlike, or both, in the human being
(Virg. Ecl. vi. 22, x. 273 Tibull. ii. 1, 55; and ‘⁶ Religious
Experience,'’ p. 89, note 46).
