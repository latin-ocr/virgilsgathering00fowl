taken refuge with the Rutuli;1 he was no typical
Etruscan, and, indeed, the people were at this
moment making an alliance with Aeneas. Servius
suggests that he was chosen to lead the procession

Mezentius must be made prominent as a bad man,
and is placed in the forefront, like a strong word at
the beginning of a line, to fix him in the reader's
mind. In the coming story much is to be made of
