the outsider the dispute is interesting as illustrating
how ruthlessly modern German criticism has attacked
the venerable traditions of Italy. There is some—
thing pathetic in the brutal disfigurement of so
pretty a conception as that of the abode of the
beardless Jupiter Anxur; and one cannot but feel
a certain sympathy with the local archaeologist, when
he inveighs against these annihilating attacks of the
Teuton, whose mind, he seems to think, is of the
Mephistophelean type, ‘ der Geist der stets verneint ' '³
