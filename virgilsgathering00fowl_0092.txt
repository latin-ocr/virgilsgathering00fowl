Virgil's “Gathering of the Clans”

not myself go so far as this; but I readily agree that
he used all the subtlest resources of his art upon her.
Whether he idealised in her some woman whom he

But it seems that certain viri docti took exception

say, is most interesting reading, for he reflects the
spirit of his own day; he preserves much valuable
antiquarian matter, too often hidden away in a mist

Virgilian magic as he ever may have had, as a con-
