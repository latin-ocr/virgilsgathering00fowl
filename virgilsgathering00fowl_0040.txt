Virgil's “Gathering of the Clans'’

out the following pages. “ Nowhere‚” he says, “not
even in the visit to Hades, is the aristocratic spirit
of Virgil manifested more plainly than in this
account of the Latin armament.’' He sees the aris-
tocratic spirit of Virgil thus strongly manifested, in
contrast to Homer’s “true spirit of a democrat”;
for the Italian gives us successive pictures of the
leaders of the tribes, hardly mentioning the rank and
file at all, while in Homer the people are described
first, and their leaders follow But what is the
general tenor of the Iliad? Surely not democratic;
it is a story of the deeds of the chiefs and their pro-
tecting deities while the people look on or fight un-
noticed. If the rank and file come first in Homer, I
think it is chiefly because the main object of the list
is to glorify the individual Greek cities and their
wealth and resources, not to uphold the democratic
principle ; and if the chiefs corne first in Virgil, I
think it is because he knew very well what treatment
would give his art its best chance. The result is,
in Dr. Henry’s own words (p. 593), with which I
cordially agree, that “while Virgil enriches the
Aeneid with a chapter second in interest and poetical
beauty to none in the whole work, Homer encumbers
the Iliad with, to say the best of it, a long dry table·
of statistical details.'' I think Dr. Henry was led
to his views about our poet’s anti-democratic mental
attitude by the curious omission of a subject to
“ gerunt '' in line 664. After telling us about the
prince or leader Aventinus, Virgil goes on abruptly:

“ pila manu saevosque gerunt in bella dolones‚”
