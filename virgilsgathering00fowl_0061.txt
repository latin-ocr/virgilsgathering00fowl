Virgil's “ Gathering of the Clans '’

understood it. He insisted that silva and virgulta
are one and the same thing, and when confronted
with the epithet ingens attached to silva he trans—
lated it “ the mighty brushwood‚ the brushwood con—
sidered in respect of its extent.'' This seems to me
to put him out of court, for the picture he suggests
is of a mountain clothed with brushwood all the way
down, and this was most certainly not what was in
Virgil's mind. The real picture is surely one of
alpine regions, and cannot be realized (visualized is
now the favourite word) any more than Tennyson's
idyll in the Princess (“ Come down, O Maid”) by
anyone who is not familiar with real mountain land-
scapes in time of storm and snow.

The picture that rises in my mind is that of a
mountain range, whose summits are hidden in cloud,
below which the snow is visible between the cloud
and the pine—forests; below the broad steep slopes of
dark pines, the silva, are the belts of deciduous trees
and underwood (virgulta)—the underwood in which
I have so often watched the warmth-loving birds of
the Alps, the Pied F lycatcher or Bonelli’s Warbler.
These four stages of the clothing of the mountain seem
to me clearly expressed by the poet. First the Cen—
taurs are nubigenae, their lair is up there in the
clouds;1 there they were born, and thence they begin

¹ Heyne saw this, and Conington quoting him with ap-
proval says that such an idea may have occurred to Virgil in
the present connection. But most of the tribe simply tell
us that the Centaurs were the offspring of Ixion and a cloud

'in the shape of Juno. Virgil is giving a new and pregnant
meaning to the old epithet.
