Virgil's “Gathering of the Clans''

Once or twice Virgil may have left a line unfinished
because the whole passage had not worked itself out
in his head. Possible examples of this are viii. 5 36
and ix. 721. But Ι cannot believe this of the simile
of the swans in vii. 702. As I have said in the text,
it is quite perfect to the words “pulsa palus,'’ which
form a hemistich. There, according to the evidence
of the great majority of hemistichia, there should be
a pause in the sense, and a passage to another topic,
or to some new aspect of the same topic. So it is in
line 760 and in the passage from the second book
quoted above (line 767). So again in iii. 218:

‘⁴ virginei volucrum vultus, foedissima ventris
proluvies uncaeque manus et pallida semper
ora fame.

Huc ubi delati portus intravimus. . . .‘'

Again, in our own seventh book, line 44, we have·
an excellent specimen of the same pause:

“ maior rerum mihi nascitur ordo,
maius opus moveo,’'

only in this case the poet has chosen to begin the
new story with the second part of the verse, instead
of beginning a new line.

In ix. 166 ff, after describing the scene in the
Rutulian camp, he comes to a close thus:

‘⁴ conlucent ignes, noctem custodia ducit
insomnem ludo,”

and then returns to the Trojans in a new line:
“ Haec super e vallo, etc.’'
