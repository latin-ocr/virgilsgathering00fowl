Virgil’s “Gathering of the Clans’'

E’en then the nursing soil of Italy:

For, being maids immortal‚ ye both mind
And can recount them; scarcely to our ears
Floats through the ages a thin breath of fame.

First to the field, despiser of the gods,
Speeds fierce Mezentius from the Tyrrhene coast,
And arms his ranks for battle; hard by him
Lausus his son, than whom no goodlier youth,
Save Turnus of Laurentum. At his back
Lausus, steed-tamer‚ heast-destroyer, leads
His thousand from Agylla's town—in vain;
Worthy of happier service as a son,

And other than Mezentius for his sire.

Behind them on the grassy sward displays
His palm-crown'd ehariot and victorious steeds
A hero, sprung from Hercules the fair,

Fair Aventinus: on his shield he bears

A hundred serpents, his ancestral sign,

The snake-encircled Hydra. Him by stealth
The priestess Rhea on wood-clothed Aventine.
Woman with god commingling, bare to light,
When the Tirynthian victor, Geryon quelled,
Arrived the fields Laurentian, and there bathed
His kine Iberian in the Tuscan stream.
Javelins and eruel pikes they wield for war,
And fight with tapering-tipped Sabellian dart.
Himself, swinging a lion’s monstrous fell
Shaggy with fearful bristles, o'er his head
Flung with its flashing teeth, thus strode on foot
Into the palace, grisly-rough, the garb

Of Hercules about his shoulders elasped.
