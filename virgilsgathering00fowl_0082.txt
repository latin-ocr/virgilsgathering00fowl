Virgil's “ Gathering of the Clans''

“ Charmers from the Marsica,” Miss Macdonell
goes on, “ used till lately to be met with in all parts
of the kingdom of Naples They carried boxes full
of snakes, which they played with, etc.’' Again:
“ To-day the art is mainly to be met with in religious
festivals. At the festa of San Domenico di Cocullo,

at Cocullo, at Villalago and elsewhere too, serpent-
charming forms a main feature of the ceremonial. On

the hermit saint who lived in caverns in the rocks, and
made friends with the wild things of the mountains,
has fallen the mantle of the early enchanters.” Fur-
ther on (p. 258) we learn the details of this inherit-
ance. On the great day of the saint, August 22, his
statue is exhibited with serpents round his neck and
twined about his arms. When it is taken out of the
church, the people crane to see the snakes, “and
shrink and peer again.'' “ At the end the snakes are
let loose among the rocks. They creep away to
crevices and holes, and for all that day in Villalago
none of them will do any hurt.’'

one from this district of the Marsi, the other not far
away, at Sulmo.1 A local legend at Sulmo, where
Ovid the magician is still a great hero, tells how he
once fled from home and disappeared. At last he
was found in the wood of Angizia—that is, in the
mystic grove of the sorceress near Luco, on the Fucine
