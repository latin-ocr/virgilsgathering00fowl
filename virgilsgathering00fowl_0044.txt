Virgil's “Gathering of the Clans‘’

The result of this treatment is magnificent poetry,
and it comes from the heart. The world of Virgil's
day was thoroughly weary of war; and in entering
on the story of the fierce struggle for Italy and
civilization which was to occupy the rest of the

cesses of his palace. Juno, the cruel enemy of the
Trojans, had herself to undertake the work (620-2).

enemy of the Trojans; that alone would not have
made it possible for a Roman poet to employ her per-
sistently against the chosen people, and against the
decrees of Fate and Jupiter. How determined
was her enmity we know from many passages,
among which there is none better than v. 781 ff:

curious one, and at no time a very important one, and
