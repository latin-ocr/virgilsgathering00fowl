Virgil’s “Gathering of the Clans''

have been through thern all, and Ι can now state
that conclusion with even greater confidence. The
result is that I am more than ever convinced that
lines 703-705 ought to be bracketed, or better still,
printed only in an apparatus criticus.

The great majority of hemistichia clearly indicate
a pause: sometimes at the end of a speech or a nar-
rative, occasionally introducing one. These merely
show that the poet was glad of an opportunity to
rest the reader’s (or listener’s) ear from that mono-
tony of the hexameter which is more apparent in
Latin than Greek, and needs, as Virgil knew only
too well, every possible artistic device to secure
variety. Exainples of this effect are numerous„
especially in the highly finished second book—ag„
233, 346, 468, 640, 720-

Sometimes the half-line is used for a pathetic
effect, and touches a sensitive ear most tenderly, as,
in the sack of Troy, ii. 767:

‘⁸ huc undique Troia gaza
incensis erepta adytis, mensaeque deorum
crateresque auro solidi, captivaque vestis
congeritur. Pueri ct pavidae longo ordine matres
stant circum.

ausus quin etiam voces iactare per umbram
implevi clamore vias. . . .

In ix. 467 there is a pause which is almost a sigh‚ atv
the very end of the tale of Nisus and Euryalus:
‘¹ quin ipsa arrectis (visu miserabile) in hastis
praefigunt capita et multo clamore sequuntur

Euryali et Nisi.
Aeneadae duri murorum in parte sinistra. . . .'‘
