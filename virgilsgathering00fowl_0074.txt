Virgil's “Gathering of the Clans’'

This is made plain by the last line (722), “Scuta
sonant pulsuque pedum conterrita tellus.'' Miss Mac-
donell, at the beginning of her interesting book, “In
the Abruzzi,” says that the modern Italian knows less
of the Abruzzi than did the ancient Roman : and that
the folk of the narrow valleys and lofty townships
are often strangers to each other. Virgil himself does
not seem quite at horne here; he follows no regular
geographical order: he begins with Amiternum on
one road, and jumps to Eretum on another: and so
too with Foruli and Casperia. Then he flies to “ cold
Nursia '' in the far north, and back again to the Tiber
valley and the fateful stream of the Allia. Here
there are two very puzzling names ; “Hortinae classes
populique Latini ”z but H. Nettleship pointed out to
Conington what is the most likely solution. In
Pliny's list of 53 Latin towns which “interiere sine
vestigiis,'' two follow each other which resemble these
two in the sound of their names: Hortenses and
Latinienses. And as Latinienses must be from
Latinium, I suspect that “ Latini '' in verse 716 is a
genitive. How Virgil got hold of these names is a
mystery which might be explained easily enough if
we had a key to it—but this we never can have. Let
me just add that this is one among many instances

of Nettleship's acuteness in such matters; of which I
can bear persona] witness.

Here for the first time we find Juno missing. Ser-
vius says she had a home at Eretum, but this may
bc only an inference from the name (Hera). But no
deity of either sex is mentioned in these lines, nor is
