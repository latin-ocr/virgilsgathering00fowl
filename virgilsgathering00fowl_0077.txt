Virgil’s “Gathering of the Clans ''

are perhaps the least interesting of the whole pageant,
though the poet knew this Oscan country rnuch better
than the mountains. Perhaps familiarity took the
edge off his imaginative powers. These peoples fall
into two groups: (Ι) those to the noxth of the Vol-
turnus, including Cales (where there was a cult of
Juno)‚1 and the Aurunci, on the picturesque coast
from Tarracina to Caieta: (2) Campania proper, and
the region of Vesuvius, with the little river Sarnus to
the south of it, on which Pompeii afterwards stood.
Having no special characteristics to bring out, Virgil
tries what can be done with ancient weapons, and
Servius comments on this without much knowledge.
But nothing seems as yet to have been made, even
by archaeologists and the new “Thesaurus'' of Latin,of
aclydes2 and casaiae. Falcati enses reminds me that
the sickle is a well-known bronze form in S. Italy,³ and
line 743 seems to suggest that Virgil was conscious
of a bronze age: “aerataeque micant peltae, micat

² Servius tells us that these two weapons were much the
same in principle, very ancient; they were said to be clubs
a cubit and a half long, studded with points or nails, and
fastened with thongs or lines in order to get them back when
flung at the enemy. (See Lersch, “ Antiq. Vergil,’' sec. 40.)
ln the “ Pagan Tribes of Borneo‚” i. 181, we read of “ heavy
bars of ironwood, sharpened at both ends, which were
hurled in the defence of a house so that the bar twirls in the
air as it hurtles through it.” Ι should like to know whether
this weapon is secured by a line: it seems probable‚ as
otherwise it might be made use of by the enemy.
