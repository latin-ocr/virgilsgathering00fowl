Virgil's “ Gathering of the Clans '‘'

Surely this is the war-paint of a very rude chief of
foot-soldiers: the metamorphosis is too sudden:
there is something wrong about the lines. which must
be either an unfinished fragment, or in their wrong
place. I incline to the latter solution, and will ven-
ture to suggest that they really belong to the Sabine
Ufens, whose description is very briefly, almost
abruptly, told in lines 744-749. Why they should have
got out of their place in early copies of the Aeneid
I cannot explain, unless possibly the “Herculeus
amictus ‘’ of line 669 was taken by the first editors as
belonging to the son of Hercules (Aventinus). But if
we apply this line to Ufens it fits in quite naturally;
Hercules was well known among the Sabines.l The
lion-skin (666) suggests that Virgil had in his mind
some figure of Hercules, though l do not find that
the lion's head was ever made into a helmet for the
god. This may, however, be a detail of Etruscan art,·
which lox-cd the grotesque and all “frightfulness.'' It
was apparently an old Italian practice to wear the
skin os an animal, often a victim, over the head.2

Tho following· description of a war-coat of the present day
is from “ Tho. Pagan Tribes of ssornoo‚'‘ by Hose and
Menougau, vol. i.‚ p. 163, but it does not quite include a use
os tho :mimal’s head as a helmet : “ The war-coar is made of
tho >kin of tho goat, the bear, or (in the case of distinguished
chivfs) of tho figor-cal. Tho whole of the skin in one piece is
