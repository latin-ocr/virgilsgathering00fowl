Virgil’s “Gathering of the Clans”

Lines 783-802.——“ Turnus and its multitudinous
followers '³ ε
“ Ipse inter primos praestanti corpore Turnus

vertitur arma tenens et toto vertice supra est.

cui triplici crinita iuba galea alta Chimaeram

sustinet Aetnaeos efflantem faucibus ignes;

tam magis illa fremens et tristibus effera flammis,

quam magis effuso crudescunt sanguine pugnae.”

Here at last Virgil gives his imagination a loose

rein. So far all his descriptions of warriors have
been well within the range of the actual or possible;
but Turnus is the mightiest of all the warriors in
these last six books, who would have slain Aeneas
himself but for divine interference, and therefore the
helmet at least of Turnus must be one of supernatural
power. It carries a Chimaera as well as a triple
plume, and the Chimaera breathes ont flame like
Aetna, flame that grows fiercer and more grisly
(tristibus effera flammis) as the heroic wearer
plunges further into the fight and the fight grows
ever more bloody. There is no need here to trouble
about construction or archaeological accuracy : Virgil
is leaving such considerations behind him, and ex-
pects you to follow. He may have seen some mar-
vellous helmet painted on an Etruscan vase, which
fired his imagination; but Turnus is here something
more than ordinary man, and his helmet is at this
imaginative moment to seem much more than an
ordinary helmet.l The shield, with a golden Io
