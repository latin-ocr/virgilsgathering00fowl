Virgil's “ Gathering of the Clans''

mean? And is the same true of the Europe of
to-day, or of his day, fifty years ago? Assuredly
not: human nature does not really differ from age to
age—it is only the surface that is touched by passing
gusts of literary fashion, which sometimes fail to
bring to active expression the abiding love and ten-
derness beneath. And indeed it is not true, far from
it, that the poetry of Virgil’s day failed to express
‘chat love and tenderness; nor was it so in Henry’s
own time. This very accent of sorrow that “ breathes
a pathetic murmur into Nature's peace’' is to be
found in the most Virgilian of English poets, writing
while Henry was voyaging through the Aeneid ;

“ Unloved, by many a sandy bar,
The brool< shall babble down the plain,
At moon, or when the lesser wain
Is twisting round the polar star,

Uncared for, gird the windy grove,
And flood the haunts of hern and crake ;
Or into silver arrows break

The sailing moon in creek and cove3

Till from the garden and the wild

A fresh association blow,

And year by year the landscape grow
Familiar to the stranger's child :

As year by year the labourer tills
His wonted glebe‚ or lops the glades :
And year by year our memory fades
From all the circle of the hills.''

We moderns express the feeling in a different way:

but the tears are there.
