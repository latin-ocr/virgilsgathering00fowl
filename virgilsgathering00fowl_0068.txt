city, the tradition was matter of common belief.1
Both cities were reputed Etruscan, but of Falerii at
least we know that the Etruscan element was rather
a veneer than a substantial character ; recent re-

Hellenic elements as well„2 They have also shown
the great size and importance of Falerii and its
suburb or appendage known now as Narce. Juno
was here a great deity, and her “sacred marriage,'’
described charmingly by Ovid ((Ἀῑηοτεε,Η iii. 13), is
