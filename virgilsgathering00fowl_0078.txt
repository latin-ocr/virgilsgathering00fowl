Italy, but did not then grow there, as Pliny proves.l
Cato, de Agric.‚ 120 speaks of cork used for wine-
bottling, and Pliny tells us that then, as now, cork
was used for ladies' shoes in winter.

Line 740 is famous for the curious story that Virgil

wrote originally,

and afterwards changed “ Nolae '' to “ Abellae '' (no
doubt this should be read, not “ Bellae'’), owing to a
quarrel with the people of Nola. This story first ap-

it “ in quodam commentario.'' (The date of Gellius is
about the middle of the second century of the Empire.)
Vergilius, he says, asked the Nolani to let him use a
river, which must have been the Clanius, to irrigate
certain lands: whether these were his own property
or not does not appear, but at any rate the request

“propter sibi negatum hospitium '’: but the Servian
Interpolator adds the story about the water, quoting
Gellius as his authority. We may accept ‘the tradi-

also quotes Plutarch “ Camillus‚'’ 25 for a story (not in Livy)
that Camillus used corks to cross the Tiber when relieving
Rom(¹ from the Gauls.
