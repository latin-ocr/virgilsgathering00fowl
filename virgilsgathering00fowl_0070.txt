Virgil’s ‘⁶ Gathering of the Clans'’

Another word that suggests this character for the
king and his people is the aequos applied to the men
of Falerii. I have no hesitation in following Servius
here,1 who adverts to the tradition that the ius fetiale
originated at Falerii, and gives aequos the sense of
“ righteous ’' Γ( iustos ”). No other suggested ex-
planation of the word is so much in harmony with
the general colouring of the picture. Mr. Mackail, it
is true, translates ‘⁶ the Faliscan levels''; but Falerii
is among the hills, and was built on a strong rocky
position falling steeply to the stream that ran down
to the Tiber from the Ciminian lake.

A word about two other points. ln the lines

“ hi Fescenninas acies, aequosque Faliscos,
hi Soractis habent arces. . . . '

the puzzle has always been to make out what is meant
by acies and arces respectively: and acies has often
been judged corrupt, owing to the harshness of the
zeugma with which it and arces are held together by
the verb “ habent.” True, the passage may have been
left unfinished 2 but there are the two words, and we
must make the best of them. What shall we say of
arces :⁹ There was no town on Soracte at any time,

¹ True, on x. 14 Servius gives a different account, accord-
ing to which Ancus Martius sent to the gens Aequiculana
for the ius fetiale, following Livy, i. 32, who himself followed
a tradition suggested by the name Aequi and Aequicoli.
Dionysius has another story connecting the. ius with Ardea
(ii. 71). Undoubtcdly it was common to the Italic peoples
who niigrated from the north and developed their civilization
in the period of the terrermare.
