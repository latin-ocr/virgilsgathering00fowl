Virgil's “ Gathering of the Clans’

gramina nec teneras cursu laesisset aristas,

vel mare per medium fluctu suspensa tumenti
ferret iter celeris nec tingeret aequore plantas.
illam omnis tectis agrisque effusa iuventus
turbaque miratur matrum et prospectat euntem,
attonitis inhians animis ut regius ostro

velet honos levis umeros, ut fibula crinem

auro internectat, Lyciam ut gerat ipsa pharetram
et pastoralem praefixa cuspide myrtum.”

The pageant ends with the most beautiful of all
its figures. Virgil, in describing the hero of these
last six books, had already ventured a touch of the
supernatural; here he indulges his imagination still
more strongly.1 Camilla, who bears a name that
should awake the national spirit in every Italian‚2
and prepare him for an idealised heroine, is re-
vealed more fully in the eleventh book, where the
wonderful story of her infancy is told; but in these
few lines her portrait is already perfect, without a
flaw in thought or expression. One good critic has
suggested that she was the poet's ideal woman,
rather than the wild and passionate Dido. I should

² The children of noble parents assisted in the religious
rites of the household as “ camilli '' and “ camillae '' (see
“ Roman Religious Experience,‘’ p. 177 ff..) This is one of the
many indications that virgil meant to give the figures in his
pageant a semi-religious character, quite in conformity with
the primitive ideas about the “sacredness ” of war (see
‘⁶ Golden Bough,” part ii., p. 157 ff). There are plenty of
Roman proofs of this sacredness. In his choice of a name
Virgil would also be thinking of Camillus, who more than

any other in the shadowy annals of early Rome represents
the ideal type of Roman warrior.
